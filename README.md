# EDA_and_MODEL_CRYPTO

 This project has a forecasting model which was built using LSTM for predicting the prices of crypto currencies and it also has 
 several other informatic graphs to let the users know more about crypto currency's trend in recent days using plotly. 
 The project was built to be hosted using Streamlit.
 For the data to train the model and for visualization, an automatic script was made to web scrap the crypto currency data using yfinance.
